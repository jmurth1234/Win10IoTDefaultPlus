IoT Core Default App Plus
===============

## What is this?

This is a fork of the default startup app on the Windows 10 IoT that adds an app 
launcher as a SplitView, allowing the user to launch applications on the device.

Other features might be added in the future, such as application uninstalling, 
pinning the SplitView, and more!

## How to install?

Clone this repository on a Windows computer with VS 2015 and all the necessary
stuff for Windows 10 IoT installed. 

Once downloaded, open the sln in Visual Studio, then deploy this app to your 
remote device.

You can also install this on your computer, however it's a bit pointless as it 
just runs in a window.

Note: I have tested this on the latest insider preview (Build 14986). No idea 
whether it works on earlier builds.
